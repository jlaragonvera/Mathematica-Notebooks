# Mathematica-Notebooks


## ShellModel 

**ShellModel.nb** is a *Mathematica 13.1* Notebook with a mathematical model based on parametric surfaces for the shell morphology of the phylum Mollusca

The notebook contains the mathematical model itself as well as graphic representations and a measurement procedure for digital images of real specimens. Created by Gabriela Contreras-Figueroa and José L. Aragón.

Details of the mathematical model, as well as the measurement process can be found in the article "A Mathematical Model for Mollusc Shells Based on Parametric Surfaces and the Construction of Theoretical Morphospaces", by Gabriela Contreras-Figueroa and José L. Aragón, Diversity 2023, 15(3), 431; https://doi.org/10.3390/d15030431.

## Turing patterns

**TuringPatterns1D.nb** is a *Mathematica 14.3* Notebook to solve a reaction-diffusion system in a linear domain with Newman boundary conditions and random initial conditions, using finite elements.


## Weakly nonlinear analysis

**BVAMMultiscalingAnalysis.nb** is a *Mathematica 14.3* Notebook where a muliscale nonlinear analysis is applied to the Barrio-Varea-Aragon-Maini reaction-diffusion model using the diffusion coefficiente as bifurcation parameter.

## Coincidence Site Lattices of the planar hexagonal lattice

**HexagonalCSL.nb** is a *Mathematica 14.3* Notebook to calculate the coincidence index and a basis of the coincidence lattice of two planar hexagonal lattices with a twist angle defined by two integers p and q, using Theorem 4.6 in M.A. Rodríguez-Andrade et al. Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 25 (2015), 425-440.
