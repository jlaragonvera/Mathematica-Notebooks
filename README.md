## ShellModel 

**ShellModel.nb** is a *Mathematica 13.1* Notebook with a mathematical model based on parametric surfaces for the shell morphology of the phylum Mollusca

The notebook contains the mathematical model itself as well as graphic representations and a measurement procedure for digital images of real specimens. Created by Gabriela Contreras-Figueroa and José L. Aragón.

Details of the mathematical model, as well as the measurement process can be found in the article "A Mathematical Model for Mollusc Shells Based on Parametric Surfaces and the Construction of Theoretical Morphospaces", by Gabriela Contreras-Figueroa and José L. Aragón, Diversity 2023, 15(3), 431; https://doi.org/10.3390/d15030431.
